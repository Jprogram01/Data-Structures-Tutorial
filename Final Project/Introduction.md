# Data structures tutorial

## Introduction:

Data structures are different structures that store data in such a way that the data inside can be used efficiently. This tutorial will be covering these three different data structures: Queue, Linked List, Tree.

A useful diagnostic tool for analyzing how well you use your data structure is analyzing its "Big O" efficiency. Big O represents the time it takes an algorithm to run. The notation looks like O(), where the efficiency is inside the parenthesis. O(1) is constant time, O(n) is linear. O(n^2) is exponential and so forth. A simple way to find out the efficiency is how many loops the code has. You can image an "n" as a loop; so if a piece of code has one for loop, it is O(n), if it has nested loops, thats when it gets exponential, such as a for loop inside of a for loop. It is also a common pratice to only show the n complexity and remove the constants. An example of this is if you have a piece of code that has 2 loops, but is not nested, which comes out to O(2n), 2 is a constant there, and can be taken out. Therefore the code can still just be represented as O(n)
