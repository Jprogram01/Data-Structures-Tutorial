# Tree

A tree is data structure that is similar to a linkedlist, in that it is made up of nodes that are connected to each other that hold information. A tree is made up of nodes, that are connected by "edges" or "branches".A node can have many child nodes. Child nodes are nodes that a parent node points to. A node can have any number of child nodes, or no child nodes at all. A node that has no child nodes are called the "leaf nodes" and are bascially the end of a branch of a tree. The highest node is called the root. It has no parent node.

Trees are beneficial because they are predictable and efficient. A node can only have one parent node, therefore there are no loops in the structure, and its easier to avoid errors in your algorithm. The efficiency of a tree is linear, or O(n).

A common way a tree is used is to store numbers. The set up is Nodes will point two different nodes. The child node to the left will hold smaller numbers than the parent node, the node to the right will hold higher numbers then the parent node.
